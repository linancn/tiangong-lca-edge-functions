# edge-functions Validation Guide

## Default Baseline

Unless the change is doc-only, the default local baseline is:

```bash
pnpm lint
pnpm check
```

`pnpm check` first requires exact Deno `2.1.4` / bundled TypeScript `5.6.2`, Supabase CLI `2.116.0`, Node `24.19.0`, and pnpm `11.24.0`. It then checks all 152 enabled `supabase/functions/*/index.ts` and `test/*.ts` roots in one shared graph, runs 73 Node contract tests, and executes 505 default Deno behavior tests while the one credentialed live Upstash test remains ignored unless explicitly selected. Deno is the authoritative compiler; no npm TypeScript package participates.

Review note, 2026-08-31: Edge #357 upgrades every direct runtime/import dependency to the latest stable version verified for exact Deno 2.1.4, including OpenAI 7.8 and Supabase JSR 2.112.4. Validation requires empty `pnpm outdated` and exact-Deno `deno outdated --latest`, one import-map/direct-import contract, targeted OpenAI/Redis/Supabase/Auth checks, Redis 0.41.2's dual-provider signature adaptation, the canonical full gate, and no Portal credential/config mutation. Official OpenAI documentation continues to define `client.responses.create` as the primary JavaScript API; Chat fallback remains covered.

Review note, 2026-08-31: Edge #361 closes the Functions JS pin gap found during Production promote review. The dependency contract must scan every TypeScript source/test/script quoted specifier containing `@supabase/functions-js`, detect synthetic JSR, versioned JSR, npm, and HTTPS bypasses, accept only `@supabase/functions-js/edge-runtime.d.ts`, and resolve that alias to exact 2.112.4 in `supabase/functions/deno.json`. The rewrite is type-only; request examples and runtime behavior remain unchanged, and Portal Functions are not remotely deployed by this fix.

The current baseline intentionally skips:

- `antchain_*`

If you reactivate or rely on that route family, update the inventory and validation story in the same change. The retired generic non-FT embedding route is intentionally absent, while active `embedding_ft` routes stay covered.

## Validation Matrix

| Change type | Minimum local proof | Additional proof when risk is higher | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| One function entrypoint or nearby handler | `pnpm lint`; `pnpm check`; targeted `deno check --config supabase/functions/deno.json <changed-entry-or-handler>` | use `test.example.http` or an equivalent request to smoke the changed path | For handler-based functions, validate both the entrypoint and the extracted handler file. |
| Shared auth or Portal Redis module | `pnpm lint`; `pnpm check`; `deno test --allow-env --allow-read --config supabase/functions/deno.json test/auth_test.ts test/redis_runtime_env_contract_test.ts`; targeted `deno check` on `_shared/auth.ts`, `_shared/redis_client.ts`, and directly affected consumers | run `pnpm probe:auth --dry-run`; run a local or remote probe if the change affects credential selection | Prove ordinary JWT uses `getClaims` without `getUser`, validates required authority claims, and carries `client_id`/`session_id` into the minimal principal. Prove `fresh_user` performs the online lookup only for its reviewed identity-sync route. Opaque, foreign-issuer, and password-encoded bearers must return canonical HTTP 401 through Supabase verification with no fallback I/O, including the SDK status-400 failure shape. Status-0/network failures must return 503, throttling must remain 429, and upstream 5xx must remain retryable rather than forcing client logout. Generic auth Redis code/env and external account-bridge code/env/dependencies must be absent while Portal-prefixed providers and databases remain unchanged. `gateway_invalid_jwt` and `function_auth_failed` remain different failure classes. |
| Command runtime, command handlers, or DB-RPC wrappers | `pnpm lint`; `pnpm check`; targeted `deno check` on changed `_shared/command_runtime/**`, `_shared/commands/**`, `_shared/db_rpc/**`, and at least one direct consumer | run nearby repo tests such as `test/command_runtime_test.ts`, `test/dataset_command_rpc_contract_test.ts`, or `test/review_command_rpc_contract_test.ts` | If the change depends on new SQL or RPC truth, record the `database-engine` follow-up explicitly. |
| Application-wide database Schema cutover | `pnpm lint`; `pnpm check`; the canonical `pnpm test:deno` permission boundary; `test/schema_boundary_contract_test.ts` must pass | compare every literal Edge RPC with the exact database-engine `api` catalog and run focused behavior tests for every replaced direct relation path before mirroring to Next | Shared clients default to `api`; direct core-table access selects `public`; no Edge Data API call selects `private` or a non-core relation. Preserve authorization, DTO, idempotency, terminal-error, and storage-signing behavior while moving persistence behind façades. |
| Data Product closure commands, certificate-bound result builds, TaskSummaryV2 feed, or closure-artifact signing | `pnpm lint`; `pnpm check`; `deno test --allow-env --config supabase/functions/deno.json test/data_product_command_test.ts`; `deno test --allow-env --allow-net=127.0.0.1 --config supabase/functions/deno.json test/data_product_command_http_smoke_test.ts`; targeted `deno check` on `app_data_product_commands`, `_shared/commands/data_product/**`, and `_shared/db_rpc/data_product_commands.ts` | against a local database-engine stack, prove owner/manager and cross-user denial, a v2 build does not double-enqueue its persisted job, feed rows expose no payload/locator/signed URL, closure-check reads expose exactly two locator-free availability summaries, and only the requested XLSX or machine-result manifest is signed from a ready unexpired actor-bound descriptor; also prove strict selector forwarding, semantic filenames, the artifact-expiry safety budget, delayed-signing boundary, stable owner-visible `410`, opaque unavailable/unauthorized `404`, sanitized unexpected-RPC/signing `502`, and recursive locator/credential rejection | Database owns scope normalization, Certificate validity, feed ACL, artifact lifecycle, and artifact authorization. Edge must keep request/descriptor schemas strict, expose only the reviewed public projection, call the two-argument RPC, and keep bucket/object paths and all source error details inside the service-only signing step. The local HTTP smoke must traverse the function handler plus real Supabase SDK PostgREST/Storage transports; unit-only `FakeRpc` proof is insufficient for this boundary. Partition selectors are outside this public endpoint. |
| Disposable Portal R0 HMAC/Redis interoperability fixture | `pnpm lint`; `pnpm check`; `deno test --allow-env --allow-read --allow-net=127.0.0.1 --config supabase/functions/deno.json test/portal_r0_hmac_transport_test.ts test/portal_r0_redis_test.ts test/portal_r0_redis_live_fixture_test.ts test/portal_r0_hmac_verify_v1_test.ts test/portal_r0_deploy_contract_test.ts`; `node --test scripts/deploy-portal-r0-fixture.test.cjs scripts/cleanup-portal-r0-fixture.test.cjs`; targeted `deno check` on `portal_r0_hmac_verify_v1` and `_shared/portal_r0_*` | from one clean exact SHA, use only the exact nondefault/nonpersistent/no-data Supabase Preview branch returned live by `branches list --output-format json` from the configured Main parent and bound to explicit branch name/Git branch/optional PR number, one-time R0 identities/secret copies, R0-only Redis variables, and `portal:r0:<fixture>:v1`; the approved shared Upstash endpoint/token may be mapped only into that surface. Capture interoperability and rotation, delete exact receipt-bound fixture keys and verify absence, remove temporary Preview secret copies and the exact Function, and preserve the shared database plus Dev/Main namespaces | Deploy additionally requires `FUNCTIONS_DEPLOYED`, `ACTIVE_HEALTHY`, and future expiry within 24 hours. Cleanup retains the exact identity/clean-SHA/separate-ack checks but permits expired, paused, unhealthy, or failed branches and attempts Function deletion; actual delete failure blocks. It must never use broad scans/prefix deletion, delete the shared Upstash resource, touch Dev/Main namespaces, or rotate the coordinated source token for one environment. An absent target in a valid nonempty Main-parent response is terminal. 403, malformed, and empty responses fail closed. `test` remains local-only. Current/previous require distinct IDs and constant-time-distinct secrets; both-empty means absent while one-sided empty fails. HMAC precedes transport, nonce, Lua, and JSON. |
| Portal HMAC or published LCIA wrapper | `pnpm lint`; `pnpm check`; `deno test --allow-env --allow-read --config supabase/functions/deno.json test/portal_hmac_test.ts test/portal_redis_guard_test.ts test/portal_data_product_results_v1_test.ts test/portal_deploy_contract_test.ts`; targeted `deno check` on `portal_data_product_results_v1`, `_shared/portal_hmac.ts`, `_shared/portal_redis_guard.ts`, `_shared/portal_security_event.ts`, and `_shared/redis_client.ts` | use disposable, non-production Portal-only Upstash and Standard Redis fixtures plus the matching database-engine migration to prove `SET NX EX`, Lua atomicity/recovery count, current/previous rotation, Preview/Production isolation, no unprefixed Redis fallback, publishable-only RPC transport, exact DTO validation, 60-second revoke visibility, and unavailable-not-zero behavior; run the pinned CLI source fixture and actual public-path serve probe when Docker is available | HMAC canonical bytes always use the public path; runtime accepts only public and exact CLI-stripped paths. HMAC finishes before exact public-apikey match and Cookie rejection. Pinned CLI `2.116.0` maps the matched publishable key into `sb-api-key` without injecting Authorization; only the narrow exact older-local-client anon Bearer remains compatible at `http://kong:8000`, and every other Authorization fails. Portal provider/credential configuration is exclusively `PORTAL_REDIS_*` / `PORTAL_UPSTASH_REDIS_*`; missing values fail closed and no generic Edge auth Redis surface exists. Redis outage fails closed. Lease defaults to 30 seconds, minimum 20, and covers Redis+upstream+5 seconds. LCIA cache is at most 60 seconds and never decides visibility. Every response/event shares one correlation UUID; exactly one safe non-blocking event records fixed outcomes/backend and no request, identifier, credential, Redis, cache-value, or locator fields. Downstream uses explicit `Content-Profile: api` and the same once-resolved public credential; `sb_secret_*`, `service_role`, artifacts, and service clients remain forbidden. Gateway JWT stays disabled through existing serve/deploy scripts. |
| Portal R2 signed Hybrid runtime | `pnpm lint`; `pnpm check`; `deno test --allow-env --allow-read --config supabase/functions/deno.json test/portal_hmac_test.ts test/portal_redis_guard_test.ts test/portal_hybrid_contract_test.ts test/portal_hybrid_search_v1_test.ts test/portal_deploy_contract_test.ts test/hybrid_search_handler_test.ts test/hybrid_query_utils_test.ts`; targeted `deno check` on `portal_hybrid_search_v1`, `_shared/portal_hybrid_*`, `_shared/portal_public_transport.ts`, `_shared/portal_redis_guard.ts`, `_shared/hybrid_search_kernel.ts`, and `_shared/openai_structured.ts` | after `api.portal_hybrid_search_v1` exists in a disposable/non-production Database, prove exact request/response parity, anonymous 100/200 scope, ranking/evidence/card hydration, candidate uniqueness, one atomic nonce/replay/expired-lease-recovery/budget/concurrency-lease/circuit admission call, valid-payload-before-cache-read precedence, concurrent cache-miss rewrite plus original-query 1024-dimensional embedding, overlapped cache-write/Database work with settled telemetry before Database-error finalization, peer cancellation on either provider failure, per-provider outcome/latency evidence, the absolute 25-second Edge handler-entry deadline with five seconds of headroom before the 30-second Portal BFF deadline, the 35-second lease covering Redis plus cleanup recovery, atomic-begin/cache deadline crossing, OpenAI/SageMaker/PostgREST shared abort, DB-after-both ordering, DB-success/reset timeout, non-blocking lease cleanup/TTL recovery, bounded background logger delivery, circuit threshold/recovery, cache expiry, minute/day/concurrency load, and BFF lexical fallback; run the exact public-path serve probe and disposable Upstash/Standard Redis fixtures when available | Invalid/cross-function HMAC, public transport failure, disabled switch, replay, admission Redis outage, budget, concurrency, and open circuit must produce zero OpenAI/SageMaker/DB calls. The Hybrid-only Lua registers nonce first, stops replay before recovery/counters, removes expired leases before budget/concurrency reads, applies budget/concurrency before circuit, returns an admitted open-circuit lease for normal cleanup, and reports recovered leases without including cache/query/body-hash data. Only admitted closed requests reach JSON/schema and the separate hash-only cache read, so cache failure cannot displace `invalid_request`. Cache misses then start both provider-explicit calls; they share one request operation signal inherited from the absolute deadline, either provider failure aborts its surviving peer before response/lease release, the embedding input is the original bounded query, rewrite output alone supplies interpretation/fulltext terms, and database work waits for both. The validated model-cache write overlaps the public Database query under the same deadline; both settled outcomes are inspected before a Database rejection event is sanitized so `write_failed` remains observable. Every awaited Redis/model/database/finalization operation is capped by the same remaining deadline; a late cache/circuit/model/database result cannot start downstream work or return 200, and cleanup never delays the response. Event sanitization precedes the last deadline decision; success records both stages `succeeded`, cache hits record both `cache_hit`, a provider failure records that stage `failed` and its peer `aborted`, and deadline paths retain fixed `aborted` outcomes plus nullable bounded latencies. No event contains query, model name, endpoint, provider error, identifier, or credential. The final status/error code must match the returned response. Exactly one logger invocation is scheduled outside the handler promise through `EdgeRuntime.waitUntil` or the handled local macrotask fallback. A synchronously blocking logger cannot delay response resolution or produce a late 200, and throwing, rejecting, or never-settling loggers remain bounded best effort. Cache-write and circuit-reset non-timeout errors remain observable best effort. Filter bounds apply after trim/lowercase normalization and include Unicode expansion. The switch enables only for exact lowercase `true`; default is false. Model cache keys are body hashes, values omit the raw query and candidates, and TTL is at most 60 seconds. Downstream is only publishable `api.portal_hybrid_search_v1`, never legacy raw Hybrid RPCs or a service client. Response interpretation is advisory/model-generated; every database item is an exact R1 public card with exhaustive reference/functional-unit/technology/source/quality context and evidence-backed rank fields. Missing or malformed context and raw/private/locator fields fail closed. Correct semantic completion, not a latency percentile, is the release criterion; elapsed time remains observed for optimization. Fixed failures contain no lexical results; the BFF owns fallback. No wildcard CORS or unsafe event field is allowed. Live provider/deployment proof remains a separate gate. |
| Scope-closure Edge provider qualification adapter | `deno test --allow-env --config supabase/functions/deno.json test/scope_closure_edge_qualification_test.ts`; targeted `deno check` on `scripts/scope_closure_edge_qualification.ts`; execute `scripts/run_scope_closure_edge_qualification.sh` twice from a clean exact commit with the same `--run-id` and compare outputs; validate one result with the exact Worker provider-owner aggregator contract | feed the git-tracked adapter to Worker `scripts/run_scope_closure_provider_qualification.sh` with the other owner adapters and isolated Linux provider dependencies when the full provider run is coordinated | The adapter accepts only explicit loopback/non-production qualification configuration, binds `componentSha` to a clean exact checkout, drives the real Edge handler and Supabase SDK against a generated loopback fixture, proves owner/cross-owner/ready/expiry/retry/HEAD/range/direct-object behavior for XLSX and manifest roles, and emits only deterministic locator-free `lcia.scope-closure-provider-owned-result.v1` evidence with `productionMutation=false`. |
| LCI/LCIA release commands, artifact verification, or public release reads | `pnpm lint`; `pnpm check`; `deno test --allow-env --config supabase/functions/deno.json test/lca_release_command_test.ts test/lca_release_results_test.ts`; targeted `deno check` on both release entrypoints | against a local database-engine stack, exercise prepare → upload → finalize → approve → publish → signed readback with a `data_product_manager`, then repeat a mutation and private read with a non-manager | Prove all four profile/format pairs, canonical content-addressed object paths, retryable signed-upload upsert at only the same immutable identity, exact byte/hash checks, actor-role recheck before service finalize, public access both without Authorization and with the matching project publishable/legacy anon Bearer credential, private denial, Calculation Bundle manifest binding/path safety and preview-shard signing, exact five-role LCIA XLSX/CSV + LCI Parquet/CSV + audit ZIP projection, server-derived semantic download filenames, locator removal, and failure before any service mutation. Live deployment is separate proof. |
| Direct review submission, Review Admin quality diagnostic, or legacy Gate/coordinator compatibility | `pnpm lint`; `pnpm check`; targeted `deno check` on `app_dataset_submit_review`, `admin_review_quality_diagnostic`, changed dataset/review command files, and DB-RPC wrappers; run `test/app_dataset_submit_review_test.ts`, `test/admin_review_quality_diagnostic_test.ts`, and `test/dataset_command_rpc_contract_test.ts`. When compatibility code changes, also run the existing Gate, submit-job, worker-job, and coordinator tests | smoke direct submit and diagnostic start/read against a dev environment only after the matching database-engine RPCs and Worker runner exist; separately verify any already queued legacy submit job can drain | New submit traffic must call stable `cmd_review_submit` with no Gate authority. Legacy Process Gate fields may be accepted during the compatibility window but are ignored. The diagnostic accepts no client-selected Review/Process scope, preserves database-owned Review Admin denial, and returns `findings`, `not_evaluable`, and `failed` as informational report states that never disable review actions. |
| Hybrid search, foundation-dataset extraction, `embedding_ft`, or OpenAI shared layer | `pnpm lint`; `pnpm check`; targeted `deno check` on changed entrypoints and shared helpers; run `test/dataset_extraction_worker_test.ts`, `test/foundation_dataset_extraction_test.ts`, `test/embedding_ft_job_test.ts`, `test/embedding_ft_postgres_test.ts`, `test/embedding_vector_test.ts`, `test/hybrid_search_handler_test.ts`, `test/hybrid_query_utils_test.ts`, `test/hybrid_search_request_test.ts`, and `test/hybrid_search_rpc_context_test.ts` when the shared foundation search path changes | on the exact non-production deployment whose database contains the matching v2 RPCs, drain a bounded extraction/embedding batch and smoke all seven routes; cover Contact, FlowProperty, Source, and UnitGroup requests for `tg` plus JWT-backed `my`/`te`; prove state/team context reaches both the initial RPC and threshold fallback, while Process, Flow, and LifecycleModel receive no visibility-only fields; confirm stale extraction identities ACK without writes and invalid table/function/column jobs fail closed; for Postgres client lifecycle changes, aggregate `pg_stat_activity` by the redacted application name, prove connections return after the idle window, and prove Edge response bodies plus queue tables retain zero new connection-slot or terminal failures | Every Hybrid payload must contain one `lexical_weight` and one `semantic_weight`; no second lexical control is allowed. Model defaults and entity-specific query-rewrite prompts live in repo code. Foundation Markdown is deterministic; generated vectors must be exactly 1024-dimensional. Embedding job IDs must use canonical PostgreSQL UUID text but need not carry RFC-classified version/variant bits; malformed text still fails before target evaluation. The embedding worker remains restricted to seven reviewed dataset tables and nine unique schema-qualified function targets: `api.flows_embedding_ft_input`, `private.flows_derivative_rebuild_embedding_input`, `api.processes_embedding_ft_input`, `private.processes_derivative_rebuild_embedding_input`, `api.lifecyclemodels_embedding_ft_input`, `public.contacts_embedding_ft_input`, `public.flowproperties_embedding_ft_input`, `public.sources_embedding_ft_input`, and `public.unitgroups_embedding_ft_input`; structured logs must not retain raw user query text. Each isolate processes its batch sequentially and therefore owns one short-idle, bounded-lifetime Postgres connection; do not widen that pool or raise database queue concurrency to hide connection pressure. Edge validates only field shape and forwards the user JWT; database backfill, team authorization, queue truth, RPC visibility, and HNSW plan proof remain in `database-engine`. |
| AI suggestion enqueue/read boundary | `pnpm lint`; `pnpm check`; `deno test --allow-env --config supabase/functions/deno.json test/ai_suggest_test.ts`; targeted `deno check` on `ai_suggest` and `_shared/ai_worker.ts` | against a non-production database containing `svc_ai_tidas_suggestion_enqueue/read`, enqueue one Process and one Flow, drain them with the Rust `ai-worker`, and poll through Edge to terminal results | Accept only verified Supabase JWT identities. Enforce the 2 MiB Edge input limit and the matching TIDAS root. Never return enqueue payloads, lease state, internal diagnostics, provider details, or service credentials. Database owns requester scoping and job truth; Worker owns rules, provider calls, and versioned results. |
| LCA solve, queue, result, or scope helpers | `pnpm lint`; `pnpm check`; targeted `deno check` on changed `lca_*` files and `_shared/lca_*` helpers; run `test/lca_snapshot_capabilities_test.ts` plus neighboring scope/queue tests. All-unit query artifact reader changes must run `test/lca_all_unit_query_artifact_test.ts`. Static LCIA contract changes must run `test/lca_static_cache_bundle_contract_test.ts`, `test/lca_snapshot_scope_test.ts`, `test/lca_snapshot_scope_db_test.ts`, `test/lca_snapshot_build_queue_test.ts`, and `test/lca_all_unit_solve_queue_test.ts` with `--allow-read` so raw-manifest hash parity and adversarial locator/evidence drift are covered. For worker_jobs cutover changes also run `test/worker_jobs_cutover_test.ts` and `test/worker_jobs_test.ts` | run `scripts/lca_submit_poll_fetch.sh` when the task explicitly touches the submit, poll, or fetch path; otherwise record why that proof is deferred | Prove omitted/blank `scope` resolves to `full_library`, `data_product` remains distinct, and arbitrary environment/cache labels fail before snapshot lookup or enqueue. `worker_jobs` is the default enqueue path; `LCA_WORKER_JOBS_ENABLED=false` must fail closed instead of using legacy queue fallback. Named private scope rejects old combined-scope hashes and v1 database/union LCIA evidence. Query readers retain historical v1 support and validate v2 index/chunk integrity before returning numeric values. The static source base URL is worker-trusted configuration, never a client field. Domain rows/cache remain result metadata, not task fact. Missing worker_jobs DB-side truth is validated in `database-engine`, not here. |
| TIDAS package import, export, or job paths | `pnpm lint`; `pnpm check`; targeted `deno check` on changed package files and `_shared/tidas_package.ts`; run `deno test --allow-env --config supabase/functions/deno.json test/tidas_package_test.ts test/tidas_package_api_test.ts` when package enqueue behavior changes | use the relevant requests in `test.example.http`; if auth or payload shaping changed, run a local or remote smoke path | Verified Supabase JWT coverage matters for these routes; opaque legacy bearers must fail. `worker_jobs` is the default enqueue path; `TIDAS_PACKAGE_WORKER_JOBS_ENABLED=false` must fail closed instead of using legacy queue fallback. Package domain rows/cache/artifacts stay retained metadata, not task fact. |
| Deploy script, import/dependency graph, `package.json`, `supabase/config.toml`, or PR contract files | `pnpm lint`; `pnpm outdated --format json`; exact-Deno `deno outdated --latest`; inspect branch, project-ref, import-map, direct imports, and deploy flags against `AGENTS.md`/`.docpact/config.yaml`; run `pnpm check` when runtime inventory or imports changed | run targeted OpenAI, Supabase, auth, and both Redis-provider tests for their graph changes; if the task includes a real deploy, record the environment and function names | Remote deploy proof is not implied by local lint or type-check. Scripted deploys resolve imports through `supabase/functions/deno.json`; Functions JS type imports must use the mapped alias, and any direct JSR/URL import must carry the same reviewed version. |
| Auth probe tooling | `pnpm lint`; `node scripts/probe-functions-auth.cjs --help`; `pnpm probe:auth --dry-run` | run `pnpm probe:auth --remote` or `--local` when the task explicitly includes live probe validation | Dry-run is the safe default when you only changed classification or selection logic. |
| Repo tests only | `pnpm lint`; `pnpm check`; targeted `deno check --config supabase/functions/deno.json <changed-test-file>` | run neighboring tests that cover the same shared module or function family | This repo keeps Deno tests in `test/**`, not under each function folder. |
| Repo docs or docpact config only | `scripts/docpact validate-config --root . --strict`; `scripts/docpact lint --root . --worktree --mode enforce` | perform scenario-based route checks for the affected intent surface | Refresh review metadata when governed docs change without code changes. |

The real Upstash proof is opt-in and stays outside `pnpm check`. Run `pnpm test:portal-upstash-live -- --env-file <mode-0600-file>` only with a disposable or explicitly authorized database. The source file must contain exactly `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` and `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN`; the operator runner maps them in-memory to one minimal Portal-prefixed child environment, grants no filesystem access, and restricts network access to the exact Upstash host. Every normal run unconditionally generates and prints one non-secret canonical UUIDv4 receipt before child startup; a normal `--run-id` override is rejected before credential read. The receipt's 128 bits are losslessly encoded into exact runtime-compatible namespace `portal:t<25-char-base36>:v1`, with deterministic keys isolated inside it. A normal run removes only its own exact keys before and after proving the LCIA-compatible replay/atomic-budget/concurrency/lease/cache primitives plus the Hybrid one-call replay, concurrency, TTL recovery, circuit-open, budget and cleanup contract. After interruption or cleanup failure, rerun with `--cleanup-only --run-id <retained-run-id>`; cleanup without the receipt fails before credential read or network access. The runner prints no endpoint, token, nonce, Redis key, or value. It never authorizes Function deployment or production enablement.

### Portal provider and provenance isolation proof

Changes to `portal_public_transport.ts`, `portal_hybrid_provider.ts`, `portal_hybrid_kernel.ts`, or `portal_openai_structured.ts` must additionally prove all of the following in the existing Portal test files and static deploy contract:

- `PORTAL_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` is a modern publishable key present in the current project's platform-owned `SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEYS` registry, is paired only with platform-injected `SUPABASE_URL`, matches inbound `apikey` exactly, and is reused unchanged downstream; hosted requires HTTPS and rejects Authorization, while pinned CLI `2.116.0` uses `sb-api-key` and leaves Authorization absent. Exact local `http://kong:8000` retains only the older-client anon Bearer compatibility. Generic/direct-or-helper `REMOTE_*`, legacy-anon fallback, secret/service-role, user, missing, malformed, and cross-project key/URL configurations fail before Redis, model, or database work
- exact false or unset `PORTAL_HYBRID_ENABLED` returns before Portal Redis, JSON, OpenAI, SageMaker/AWS, or database configuration is read
- enabled R2 requires the complete strict `PORTAL_OPENAI_*`, `PORTAL_SAGEMAKER_*`, and `PORTAL_AWS_*` surface and passes that exact object into both shared model kernels; generic-only, partial, malformed, whitespace-bearing, credential-bearing URL, and insecure remote URL configurations fail before provider or database calls
- Portal Responses parameters remain `store=false`, `max_output_tokens=256`, `reasoning.effort=none`, and `text.verbosity=low` with the same strict JSON Schema/model/prompts/temperature/AbortSignal; tests must reject API-key capture and any implicit `service_tier`, while Chat fallback and generic/login wrappers remain unchanged
- `hybrid_search_kernel.ts` and `openai_structured.ts` remain byte-for-byte equal to the `dev` baseline, while existing login Hybrid, embedding, auth, and shared-kernel tests pass unchanged, proving their generic environment precedence and responses were not replaced by Portal values
- LCIA reads only `PORTAL_LCIA_DEPLOYMENT_SHA`, Hybrid reads only `PORTAL_HYBRID_DEPLOYMENT_SHA`, and a missing/invalid/other-route SHA yields `unknown` rather than a cross-route or retired shared fallback

The minimum targeted command remains the union of the two Portal rows above plus `test/hybrid_search_handler_test.ts`, `test/hybrid_query_utils_test.ts`, `test/auth_test.ts`, `test/supabase_client_test.ts`, `test/embedding_vector_test.ts`, and targeted `deno check` for both Portal entrypoints and the three Portal-only provider/kernel modules. Live provider calls, secret mutation, Function deployment, and enabling Hybrid are separate controlled gates and are not implied by local proof.

## Auth And Probe Notes

Facts that matter:

- local serve uses `--no-verify-jwt`
- scripted remote deploys also use `--no-verify-jwt`
- scripted remote deploys pass `supabase/functions/deno.json` as the Supabase CLI import map
- runtime auth still happens inside functions, primarily through `supabase/functions/_shared/auth.ts`
- ordinary Supabase JWT routes use claims/JWKS by default; only `identity_login_sync` uses explicit `fresh_user`
- generic auth Redis is removed; `_shared/redis_client.ts` is Portal-only and must read only its explicit `PORTAL_*`/`PORTAL_R0_*` configuration
- `scripts/probe-functions-auth.cjs` is the fastest way to separate gateway rejection from runtime-auth rejection

Useful low-risk commands:

```bash
node scripts/probe-functions-auth.cjs --help
pnpm probe:auth --dry-run
pnpm probe:auth --remote --only lca_
```

## Docpact Governance Notes

The repo's machine-readable governance source is `.docpact/config.yaml`.

That means:

- governed-doc rules, routing intents, ownership boundaries, and freshness live in `.docpact/config.yaml`
- `.github/workflows/ai-doc-lint.yml` is manual-dispatch fallback and should delegate to the same local docpact gate
- retained explanatory docs stay in `AGENTS.md`, this file, `repo-architecture.md`, `README.md`, and the PR templates

Do not recreate deleted `ai/*` files under a new name. Keep deterministic facts in config and explanatory material in retained source docs.

## Remote Deploy Notes

Remote deploy proof is separate from local type-check proof.

If the task includes a real deploy, record:

1. whether the change tightens or expands a bounded environment value. For the 25000 ms expansion, deploy compatible code while the target still uses 6000, then set `PORTAL_HYBRID_LEASE_TTL_SECONDS=35`, then `PORTAL_HYBRID_TIMEOUT_MS=25000`; setting 25000 before the code deploy would make the old runtime fail closed
2. which deploy command ran
3. which target environment was used
4. which function names were deployed
5. which smoke proof was run after deploy, if any

If no deploy happened, say so explicitly in the PR note.

## Database Boundary Notes

When a runtime change depends on database truth:

- runtime validation stays here
- migration, RPC, or persistent branch proof stays in `database-engine`

Common examples:

- missing `lca_enqueue_job`
- changed command RPC signature or policy behavior
- changed published-state or `state_code` semantics

## Minimum PR Note Quality

A good PR note for this repo should say:

1. which local commands ran
2. which targeted `deno check` or repo test files were exercised
3. whether any deploy or probe proof was performed or deferred
4. whether any required database-side proof lives in `database-engine`

## Local Docpact Push Gate

Install the versioned local hook once per checkout:

```bash
./scripts/install-git-hooks.sh
```

The `pre-push` hook runs `scripts/docpact-gate.sh`, which delegates CLI lookup to `scripts/docpact` and performs strict config validation plus enforced lint before the push leaves the machine. It then runs non-mutating `pnpm lint` and canonical `pnpm check` as the local test gate, and aborts if the lint step changes the working tree before `pnpm check`. The wrapper checks `DOCPACT_BIN`, Cargo install locations, Homebrew install locations, and then `PATH`, so local agent shells should not fail only because bare `docpact` is unavailable. The default comparison base is `origin/dev` for routine branches and `origin/main` for promote or hotfix branches. Override it for unusual stacks with `DOCPACT_BASE_REF=<ref>` or `scripts/docpact-gate.sh --base <ref>`. The gate writes its detailed report to a temporary file so normal pushes do not create `.docpact/runs/` artifacts. The GitHub `CI` workflow is manual-dispatch only rather than an ordinary push-triggered test runner.
